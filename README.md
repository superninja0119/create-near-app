Quickly build apps backed by the [NEAR](https://near.org) blockchain


Prerequisites
=============

Make sure you have a [current version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) installed â€“ we are targeting versions `12+`.
**Note**: if using Node version 13 please be advised that you will need version >= 13.7.0


Getting Started
===============

You can configure two main aspects of your new NEAR project:

* frontend: do you want a **vanilla JavaScript** stack or **React**?
* backend: do you want your contracts to be written in **Rust** or **AssemblyScript** (a dialect of TypeScript)?

| command                                                | frontend   | backend        |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| `npx create-near-app new-awesome-app`                  | React      | AssemblyScript |
| `npx create-near-app --vanilla new-awesome-app`        | vanilla JS | AssemblyScript |
| `npx create-near-app --rust new-awesome-app`           | React      | Rust           |
| `npx create-near-app --vanilla --rust new-awesome-app` | vanilla JS | Rust           |

You can also use **yarn** instead of `npx`:

    yarn create near-app [options] new-awesome-app


Develop your own Dapp
=====================

Follow the instructions in the README.md in the project you just created! ðŸš€


Getting Help
============

Contributing
============

To make changes to `create-near-app` itself:

* clone the repository (Windows users, [use `git clone -c core.symlinks=true`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/42137273/249801))
* in your terminal, enter one of the folders inside `templates`, such as `templates/vanilla`
* now you can run `yarn` to install dependencies and `yarn dev` to run the local development server, just like you can in a new app created with `create-near-app`
