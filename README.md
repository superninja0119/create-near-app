Quickly build apps backed by the [NEAR](https://near.org) blockchain


Prerequisites
=============

Make sure you have a [current version of Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) installed â€“ we are targeting versions `12+`.


Getting Started
===============

You can configure two main aspects of your new NEAR project:

* frontend: do you want a **vanilla JavaScript** stack or **React**?
* backend: do you want your contracts to be written in **Rust** or **AssemblyScript** (a dialect of TypeScript)?

| command                                                | frontend   | backend        |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | -------------- |
| `npx create-near-app new-awesome-app`                  | React      | AssemblyScript |
| `npx create-near-app --vanilla new-awesome-app`        | vanilla JS | AssemblyScript |
| `npx create-near-app --rust new-awesome-app`           | React      | Rust           |
| `npx create-near-app --vanilla --rust new-awesome-app` | vanilla JS | Rust           |
